  <b>Some of the problems we had during implementation</b>
  <ul>
    <li>
      We did try our best to follow the implementation described by the paper.  However, the paper was 
      severely lacking in implementation details.  There were several sections within our program where 
      we were forced into making decisions without there being enough information in the paper to allow us 
      to make informed implementation decisions.
    </li>
      <ul>
        <li>For example, it didn't explain what to do when the pixel is 0 standard deviations away from its neighbors.  
    Mathematically speaking, this would give a divide-by-0 error, but the paper never addressed this edge case.
    There were several other similar issues where we didn't know what decision to make for implementation 
    just based on the paper itself.</li>
        <li>
          Another of the problems we encountered was dealing with the case when the transition points fall outside of the
          image boundaries.
        </li>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Graph cuts.  The paper was good about giving a general outline of the general algorithm (what happens, the concept, etc.), 
    but many important details required for implementation were severely lacking.  We also referred to the two other papers 
    that were mentioned within the main interpolation paper, but although the reference to the graph cuts papers was made, 
    the authors did not go into explanation as to how the graph cuts algorithm would actually be relevant to the interpolation 
    method.  The way we implemented the interpolation method did not actually require graphs at all, as we spoke about with you 
    in your office one morning (and as you also agreed with us).</li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The references were made, but the main paper's authors did not connect the graph cuts papers to how they used the 
        method within their interpolation algorithm.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>We tried tracking down and emailing the authors of the paper, but did not receive any responses.</li>
